*[Show speed]*
**"Local mode: under 500 milliseconds. AI mode: 2-3 seconds. Lightning fast."**

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Does it require an API key?"**  
A: "No! Works completely offline. Add a Gemini key for even better summaries, but it's optional."

**Q: "What makes this better than ChatGPT?"**  
A: "Three things: (1) One-click in-page workflow - no copy-paste. (2) Student-specific modes like exam prep. (3) Works offline when API fails."

**Q: "How deep are the summaries?"**  
A: "Up to 1500 tokens in Study Guide mode - that's 3-4x more detailed than typical summarizers."

**Q: "What about non-English content?"**  
A: "Currently processes in English. Future versions will support multi-language."

**Q: "Can I share summaries with classmates?"**  
A: "Yes! One-click copy to clipboard. Future: direct sharing features."

**Q: "Does it work on PDFs?"**  
A: "If the PDF is displayed in Chrome as a webpage, yes! Otherwise, copy-paste the text into any webpage."

## Visual Demo Tips

### Before Screenshots to Show

1. **Cluttered article** (before)
2. **Clean study guide** (after)
3. **Generated quiz questions**
4. **History panel** with saved summaries
5. **Mode selector** dropdown
6. **Level selector** dropdown

### Live Demo Tips

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use clean, well-formatted articles (Wikipedia ideal)
- Scroll slowly through generated content
- Highlight the different sections (Overview, Key Concepts, etc.)
- Show the speed (emphasize "3 seconds")
- Demonstrate mode switching
- Show offline mode working

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Use pages with paywalls or login required
- Demo on extension settings pages (won't work)
- Rush through the generated content
- Forget to show the "Save" and "Copy" features
- Skip explaining why student focus matters

### Backup Plan

If live demo fails:
1. Have recorded video ready
2. Use screenshots of perfect runs
3. Show code architecture instead
4. Focus on feature explanation vs live demo

## Judge Engagement Strategy

### Opening Hook
**"By show of hands, who spent hours last week reading articles online for school or work?"**

*[Most hands go up]*

**"Keep your hand up if you then had to create your own study notes AND practice questions."**

*[Fewer hands]*

**"That's the problem Clarity solves. Let me show you."**

### Technical Deep-Dive (If Judges Are Technical)

**"We use a hybrid architecture:**
- **Local NLP**: TF-based extractive summarization with position weighting
- **AI Enhancement**: Context-aware prompts adapted to academic level
- **Smart routing**: Background service worker for CORS-free API calls
- **Graceful degradation**: Automatic fallback to local mode

**Token efficiency:**
- Preprocessing reduces content by 40%
- Mode-specific prompts optimize output
- Local mode: zero API calls
- Estimated cost: $0.001-0.005 per summary"

### Impact Story (If Judges Value Social Good)

**"This extension is for:**
- The student in rural areas with spotty internet
- The first-gen college student who can't afford tutoring
- The international student navigating English academic content
- The graduate student reading 50+ papers per week

**It's not just about convenience - it's about educational equity."**
