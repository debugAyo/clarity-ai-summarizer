## üìù **Text Description:**

**Clarity** is an intelligent Chrome extension that leverages Chrome's built-in AI APIs (Summarizer and Writer) to create personalized study materials for students at different academic levels.

**Problem Solved:**
Students struggle to efficiently process and understand complex web content for studying. Traditional summarization tools provide generic outputs that don't adapt to academic levels, making them less effective for educational purposes.

**Features:**
- **Adaptive Content Generation**: Automatically adjusts language complexity and depth for High School, Undergraduate, and Graduate levels
- **Multiple Study Modes**: Quick summaries, comprehensive study guides, key concepts extraction, and exam preparation
- **Chrome AI Integration**: Uses native Summarizer and Writer APIs with Gemini Nano for local, privacy-preserving AI processing
- **Beautiful UI**: Glassmorphism design with dark/light themes
- **Export Options**: Copy, save, and history features

**APIs Used:**
- Chrome Summarizer API (for quick summaries and key concepts)
- Chrome Writer API (for detailed study guides and exam prep)
- Gemini Nano (Chrome's built-in AI model)
